      <h2 class="text1">K.Austin Collins - It is a Matrix movie that could only have come with twenty-plus years of hindsight -- and insight. I was moved, impressed -- far more than I expected to be. The emotional engineering of The Matrix Resurrections is exacting and rapturous.</h1>
      <h3 class="rating1">10/10</h3>

      <h3 class="text2">The question isn't whether this movie was necessary. It wasn't.</h3>
      <h3 class="rating2">2/4</h3>
      <h3 class="title3">Peter Travers -</h3>
      <h3 class="text3">It's been 18 years between 'Matrix' sequels, but beneath the action chaos of warring computer codes are Keanu Reeves as Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, proving that they're still romantic icons of timeless cool in a movie that's a stone-cold trip.</h3>
